Student Web App
=
This small web application was an assignment I had in my Web 2 and Web 3 class to take a mock database of student information, and displays that student data in either a table or tile view. The application also provides the user with the ability to add, edit, or remove student data. This demo shows my knowledge of the following code bases:

1.) RESTful Server (using [Node.js] and [Express])
2.) [AngularJS] web framework
3.) [Material.io] design and styling using [Angular Material]
4.) Robust HTML and CSS knowledge

### What's it do?

When you run the project and pull up the site you'll see a table of basic "dummy" student information. An angular material pop-menu will be pinned to the bottom right of you screen. Once clicked it will give you options that will allow you to add a new student to the database, delete a student from the database, edit/update student data, recover any student data deleted in your session, and also the ability to switch the display from a table view to a tile view.

### Setting up this demo

To get things setup to run this project you'll need to install the project's dependencies and libraries by running `npm install`.

Then you'll need to navigate in your browser to the address `localhost:3000` and this will allow you to view the page
